This repo is to show how to deploy your Github project to PHPFog.

Steps:
1. Get a Github account and app.  It helps to push things to this app of course :)
2. Get a PHPFog account 
2a. Go to https://phpfog.com/register and make an account.
2b. Create a "custom PHP" app after creating your account.
2c. Wait for the app to deploy (should be about 1~5 minutes). 
2d. While you wait, add your ssh pub key to phpfog(https://phpfog.com/account#/ssh_keys).

3. This is the important part. Copy the git URL of your new PHPFog app.
4. In your local github repo run this command:
    git add remote phpfog <the URL you copied>
    git push phpfog
