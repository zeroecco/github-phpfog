This repo is to show how to deploy your Github project to PHPFog.

Steps:
# Get a Github account and app.  It helps to push things to this app of course :)
# Get a PHPFog account 
## Go to https://phpfog.com/register and make an account.
## Create a "custom PHP" app after creating your account.
## Wait for the app to deploy (should be about 1~5 minutes). 
## While you wait, add your ssh pub key to phpfog(https://phpfog.com/account#/ssh_keys).
# This is the important part. Copy the git URL of your new PHPFog app.
# In your local github repo run this command:

    git add remote phpfog <the URL you copied>
    git push phpfog
